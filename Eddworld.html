<h1>Eddworld</h1>
 <p>Eddsworld is a British[3][4] Flash-animated web series created by Edd Gould. Since premiering on 20 December 2004, the series has been published through Newgrounds, DeviantArt, YouTube, Albino Blacksheep, Tumblr, BBC Online,[5] and the independent eddsworld.co.uk.

Following Gould's death on 25 March 2012,[3] Thomas Ridgewell (the former voice actor of Tom) became the series' new showrunner, launching a crowdfunding campaign to continue the show titled Eddsworld: Legacy.[6][7][8] Preceding the release of Eddsworld: Legacy's final episode, Ridgewell announced he was leaving the show and handing control of the series to Matt Hargreaves (voice actor of Matt) and Gould's family.[8][9]

On 1 January 2017, the show's website went back online with new Eddsworld comics written and illustrated by Matt Hargreaves. On 1 August 2020, a new short was released to kick off a new era of the show called Eddsworld Beyond, with Hargreaves as showrunner.[10] As of August 2021, the Eddsworld YouTube channel has more than 3 million subscribers.[11]

At the time of Gould's death, his YouTube channel had the most subscribers in the comedian category for the United Kingdom and was the 4th most viewed comedian in the United Kingdom. Eddsworld was noticed by the organisers of the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference who commissioned an episode about climate change, used in the opening ceremony of the conference.[12][13]

Synopsis
Eddsworld follows the misadventures of a group of young adult "morons" living together in a house somewhere in the United Kingdom: Edd, an artist obsessed with Coca-Cola; Tom, a jaded nihilist who lacks eyeballs; Matt, a dim-witted narcissist; and (prior to his departure) Tord, a trigger-happy Norwegian addicted to hentai. The series is generally episodic, and typically has little continuity between episodes.

Main characters
The protagonists of Eddsworld are generally depicted as hyper-exaggerated "parodies" of series creator Edd Gould and his friends.

Edd (voiced by Edd Gould [2004–2012], Tim Hautekiet [2012–2016], George Gould [2020–present]) – An adventurous artist who loves to tell puns and adores Coca-Cola and bacon.
Tom (voiced by Thomas Ridgewell [2005–2016], Ed Templer [2021–present]) – A cynical alcoholic who plays the bass guitar. He is frequently dragged along on Edd's adventures, despite frequently protesting this.
Matt (voiced by Matt Hargreaves) – A self-obsessed, dim-witted narcissist.
Tord (voiced by Tord Larsson [2005–2008], Jamie Spicer-Lewis [2016]) – A trigger-happy, hentai-addicted inventor who is often seen smoking. Tord moves away in "25ft Under the Seat", but returns with malicious intent in "The End (Part 1 and 2)". He is the only one of the four protagonists who is not English, as Tord is said to be Norwegian throughout the series.
Supporting characters
Eduardo (voiced by Chris O'Neill [2010–2011], Brock Baker [2014–present]) – Edd's next-door neighbour and bitter rival.
Jon (voiced by Eddie Bowley [2010–2016]) – Eduardo's housemate and counterpart of Tom. He is generally portrayed as extremely unintelligent, and is killed in The End (Part 2).
Mark (voiced by Ben Rudman) – Eduardo's housemate and counterpart of Matt.
The Evil Director (voiced by Christopher Bingham) – A villainous film director who attempts to clone Edd and his friends in attempts to bolster sales of his film in the eddiode: Spares
Paul (voiced by Paul ter Voorde [2008–2013]) – A military guard who takes on multiple roles throughout the series.
Zanta Claws (voiced by Josh Tomar) – A zombified version of Santa Claus hell-bent on destroying Christmas.
Ell (voiced by Vicky Gould) – The gender-swapped version of Edd.
Tamara (voiced by Chloe Dungate [2015], Rachel Kiki [2020–present]) – The gender-swapped version of Tom.
