Minecraft is a 3D survival sandbox game developed and published by Mojang, spanning multiple platforms. It was originally created by the independent video game designer Markus Persson in 2009, before giving the development to Jens Bergensten in 2011. The game has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.[1] Gameplay is in the first-person perspective,[2] with the core gameplay modes being survival, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health (optionally with a "hardcore" limit, which deletes the world after the player dies); and creative, in which players have unlimited resources, never hunger and are able to fly. The game world is composed of voxels—cubes, commonly called "blocks"—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava, which are arranged in a 3-dimensional grid. Gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects as the player pleases, while being able to move freely around the world.[3]

Spin-off games
Minecraft: Story Mode
Main article: Minecraft: Story Mode
Minecraft: Story Mode, an episodic spin-off game developed by Telltale Games in collaboration with Mojang, was announced in December 2014.[4][5][6] A physical disc that grants access to all episodes was released for the aforementioned four consoles on 27 October.[6] Wii U[7] and Nintendo Switch versions were available in 2017.[8][9] Consisting of five episodes plus three additional downloadable episodes, the standalone game is a narrative and player choice-driven, and it was released on Windows, OS X, iOS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One via download on 13 October 2015, but ever since June 25th 2019, is only available on Netflix, and only the first 5 episodes. The first trailer for the game was shown at Minecon on 4 July 2015, revealing some of the game's features. In Minecraft: Story Mode, players control Jesse (voiced by Patton Oswalt and Catherine Taber),[6] who sets out on a journey with his or her friends to find The Order of the Stone—four adventurers who slayed an Ender Dragon—in order to save their world. Brian Posehn, Ashley Johnson, Scott Porter, Martha Plimpton, Dave Fennoy, Corey Feldman, Billy West and Paul Reubens portray the rest of the cast.[10]

Minecraft: Story Mode: Season 2
The second season was released from July to December 2017. It continued the story from the first season, with the player's choices affecting elements within Season Two. Patton Oswalt, Catherine Taber, Ashley Johnson, and Scott Porter were confirmed to continue voicework for the new season. The game supports the new Crowd Play feature that Telltale introduced in Batman: The Telltale Series, allowing up to 2,000 audience members to vote on decisions for the player using Twitch or other streaming services.[11] It was shut down along with the original Minecraft: Story Mode, on June 25, 2019.

Minecraft Earth
Main article: Minecraft Earth
Minecraft Earth was an augmented reality sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios and published by Xbox Game Studios. A spin-off of the video game Minecraft, it was first announced in May 2019, and was available on Android, iOS, and iPadOS. The game allowed players to interact with the world and build Minecraft-style structures and objects that will persist and can be modified by other players. The game implemented the resource-gathering and many of the other features of the original game in an augmented-reality setting. The game had a beta release in July 2019.[12] The game was free-to-play, and was released in early access in October 2019. The game was shut down on 30 June 2021 and players who made in-game purchases on the app received a free copy of the Bedrock Edition.[13][14]

Minecraft Dungeons
Main article: Minecraft Dungeons
Minecraft Dungeons is a dungeon crawler video game developed by Mojang Studios and Double Eleven. It was published by Xbox Game Studios. It is a spin-off of Minecraft and was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One on 26 May 2020. The game received mixed reviews; many deemed the game fun and charming, with praise for its visuals and music. However, its simple gameplay and use of procedural generation received a more mixed reception, with its short story and lack of depth criticized. It is a hack and slash-styled[15][16] dungeon crawler, rendered from an isometric perspective.[17] Players explore procedurally generated and hand crafted dungeons filled with new variants of existing Minecraft monsters and also deal with traps, puzzles, bosses and finding treasure.[18][19]

Minecraft Dungeons Arcade
In early 2021, Mojang announced an arcade adaptation version of Minecraft Dungeons associated with collectible cards.[20][21]

Minecraft Legends
Main article: Minecraft Legends
Minecraft Legends is an upcoming action-strategy game developed by Mojang Studios and Blackbird Interactive, announced on June 12th, 2022 and set for a 2023 release.[22]

Films
Minecraft: The Story of Mojang
Main article: Minecraft: The Story of Mojang
A documentary about the development of Mojang and Minecraft was released in December 2012. Titled Minecraft: The Story of Mojang, the film was produced by 2 Player Productions.[23]

Untitled Minecraft film
In 2012, Mojang received offers from Hollywood producers who wanted to produce Minecraft-related TV shows; however, Mojang stated they would only engage in such projects when "the right idea comes along."[24]

Two years later, in early 2014, an attempt to crowdfund a fan film through Kickstarter was shut down after Markus 'Notch' Persson declined to let the filmmakers use the license, the given reason being that the Kickstarter was set up before any agreement with Mojang had been made.[25][26] That same month Persson revealed that Mojang were in talks with Warner Bros. Pictures regarding an official Minecraft film[27][28] which was "in its early days of development" by October of that year.[29][30] The film was scheduled for release on 24 May 2019, and was going to be directed by Shawn Levy and written by Jason Fuchs.[31][32] Levy eventually dropped out and was replaced by Rob McElhenney in 2015.[33][34]

According to McElhenney, he had been drawn to the film based on the open-world nature of the game, an idea Warner Bros. had initially agreed with and provided him with a preliminary US$150 million budget for. In 2016, early production started on the film, including having had Steve Carell contracted to star. McElhenney's Minecraft movie "slowly died on the vine," and he eventually departed the film.[35]

McElhenney left the film in August 2018, and Fuchs was replaced with Aaron and Adam Nee, resulting in a delayed release date.[36] At that time, Warner Bros. Pictures CEO Greg Silverman stepped down and was replaced by Toby Emmerich, who had a different vision for the studio.

In January 2019, Peter Sollett was announced to write and direct the film, featuring a wholly different story from McElhenney's version.[37] The film was scheduled to be released in theaters on 4 March 2022.[38] However, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Warner Bros. removed Minecraft from their release schedule. A new release date has yet to be announced.[39] Sollet instead directed Metal Lords, which released in April of 2022. That same month, production on the film was announced to be moving forward, with Jared Hess set to direct and Jason Momoa in talks to star. The film was also confirmed to be live-action.[40]

A fourth Micro World set, the End, was released in June 2014. Six more, larger Lego minifigure scale, sets became available November 2014,[55] with more released every year since.

Mojang often collaborates with Jinx, an online game merchandise store, to sell Minecraft merchandise, such as clothing, foam pickaxes, and toys of creatures in the game.[56] By May 2012, over 1 million dollars were made from Minecraft merchandise sales. T-shirts and socks were the most popular products.[24] In March 2013 Mojang signed a deal with the Egmont Group, a children's book publisher, to create Minecraft handbooks, annuals, poster books, and magazines.[57][58][59] As part for the Steve DLC for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Sakurai said that an Amiibo for Steve might be made by Nintendo in the future.[60] The Amiibo has a tentative release date of 2022 and a page on the Nintendo UK Website.[61]
